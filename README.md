ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) is a research study that focuses on understanding and identifying the early changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. It is a collaborative effort involving researchers and institutions from around the world. The goal of ADNI is to collect and analyze various types of data, including clinical, genetic, imaging, and biomarker data, to improve our understanding of the disease and develop new methods for its detection and treatment.
 please find the original fMRI data set here: https://adni.loni.usc.edu/ 
 After obtaining the raw fMRI data, it is necessary to perform standard preprocessing for fMRI.


 
# Training and Testing
